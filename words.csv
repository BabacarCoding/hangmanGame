a baker's dozen
a basket case
a blessing in disguise
a breath of fresh air
a change of heart
a gray area
a gut feeling
a long haul
a piece of cake
a rip-off
a rising tide lifts all boats
a rule of thumb
a stone's throw
a storm is brewing
add fuel to the fire
add insult to injury
against the grain
all fired up
an eye-opener
at the top of your lungs
at your fingertips
a ballpark figure
bang for your buck
barking up the wrong tree
be a catch
a pain (in the neck)
child's play
chuffed to bits
in hot water
in somebody's good books
in the red
to be on somebody's back
on the ball
on the same wavelength
only a matter of time
be that as it may
tickled pink
up in arms
beat a dead horse
beat around the bush
beats me
bend over backwards
between a rock and a hard place
birds of a feather (flock together)
bite off more than you can chew
bite your tongue
blown away
blow smoke
blow something out of proportion
break the ice
breathe down somebody's neck
bring something to light
burn your bridges
bury the hatchet
bury your head in the sand
buy it
by the skin of your teeth
call it a day
call it a night
call it even
call it quits
call somebody's bluff
call the shots
calm before the storm
can of worms
unable to see the forest for the trees
castle in the sky
catch on
catch somebody's eye
catch wind of something
change your mind
chasing rainbows
clear as mud
climb the corporate ladder
close, but no cigar
go cold turkey
come out swinging
costs an arm and a leg
you couldn't care less
cross that bridge when you come to it
cross your fingers
crunch time
cry wolf
cut somebody some slack
cut to the chase
the daily grind
a dead end
dig in your heels
do the trick
don't judge a book by its cover
down and out
down the drain
down to earth
drag your feet
draw a blank
drop out
easy as pie
easy come, easy go
easy on the eyes
eat like a bird
elbow grease
every cloud has a silver lining
face the music
fall on deaf ears
fall through the cracks
fed up
feel free
feel like doing something
few and far between
first-hand
fit the bill
flunk out
follow in somebody's footsteps
foot the bill
for good
for kicks
for the birds
for the time being
freak out
from scratch
full of it
gain ground
get a grip
get a handle on
get a kick out of something
get a move on
get a word in edgewise
get carried away
get cold feet
get cracking
get even
get hitched
get into deep water
get into gear
get it out of your system
get on someone's nerves
get on someone's case
get your act together
get your feet wet
wake up on the wrong side of the bed
get out of hand
get sacked
get something off your chest
get something straight
get the ball rolling
get the hang of
get the picture
get the point
get to the bottom of
get your act together
get your foot in the door
get your head around something
give a hand
give it a go
give it a shot
give it your all
give somebody a piece of your mind
give somebody free rein
give somebody the benefit of the doubt
give someone the cold shoulder
go all out
go down in flames
go downhill
go on about something
go the extra mile
go up in smoke
go with the flow
hand it to someone
hands down
hang in there
happy camper
have a blast
have a bone to pick
have a chip on your shoulder
have a cow
have a screw loose
have a shot at
have a word with
you have had it up to here
have it in for somebody
have second thoughts
have the blues
have your heart set on something
have your work cut out
hear (something) through the grapevine
heavy-duty
hit a snag
hit it off
hit rock bottom
hit the books
hit the hay
hit the nail on the head
hit the roof
hit the sack
hold your horses
be all ears
if need be
in a bind
in charge
in cold blood
in hand
in less than no time
in the bag
in the doghouse
in the middle of nowhere
in the nick of time
in the same boat
jog somebody's memory
jump on the bandwagon
jump the gun
just about
just my luck!
just what the doctor ordered
keep a lid on something
keep an eye on
keep it down
keep on
keep your nose to the grindstone
keep somebody in the dark
keep track
kick around
kick back
kick the bucket
kid around
knock it off
know something by heart
know something like the back of your hand
know your stuff
learn the ropes
leave a bad taste in your mouth
to leave a lot to be desired
leave no stone unturned
left, right, and center
let off steam
let somebody off the hook
let the cat out of the bag
let the chips fall where they may
let the dust settle
let your freak flag fly
lie through your teeth
like shooting fish in a barrel
like taking candy from a baby
long face
loose ends
lose your head
lose your marbles
lose your mind
lost at sea
make a difference
make a living
make a mountain out of a molehill
make believe
make do
make ends meet
make off with
make up your mind
make waves
make your day
makes sense
many moons ago
means business
mind your own business
miss the boat
miss the point
mixed up
money doesn't grow on trees
monkey around
nail it down
never mind
nip something in the bud
no hard feelings
no spring chicken
no sweat
no way!
no-brainer
not a chance
not have a clue
not have the foggiest idea
nothing to sneeze at
nothing to write home about
odds and ends
of age
off your rocker
off the beaten track
off the cuff
off the hook
off the mark
off the top of your head
on a roll
on edge
on your toes
on the back burner
on the blink
on the button
on the dot
on the level
on the line
on the tip of your tongue
once in a blue moon
your bark is worse than your bite
your lips are sealed
out of line
out of order
out of sight, out of mind
out of the blue
out of the woods
paint the town red
pass the buck
pay the price for something
pay through the nose
pick somebody's brain
play devil's advocate
play it by ear
play your cards right
point the finger
pound the pavement
pour oil on troubled waters
pull a rabbit out of a hat
pull somebody's leg
pull teeth
pull your weight
pull yourself together
push your luck
put a sock in it
put all your eggs in one basket
put your foot down
put your mind to it
put something on hold
rain cats and dogs
rain or shine
raise (a few) eyebrows
raise a stink
raise the bar
read between the lines
red tape
right on the money
it rings a bell
rock the boat
rub the wrong way
run-of-the-mill
running on fumes
safe and sound
sail close to the wind
salt of the earth
scared to death
scope out
scratch the surface
see eye to eye
see red
be able to sell ice to Eskimos
sell like hot cakes
set the record straight
set your heart on something
shake a leg
shape up or ship out
shoot from the hip
shoot the breeze
shrug off
sit on the fence
sit tight
sitting pretty
skeleton crew
a slip of the tongue
something slips your mind
small talk
sold you out
sour grapes
speak your mind
spill the beans
stand your ground
step up your game
stuck in a rut
take a back seat
take a breather
take a chance
take a crack at
take a spill
take something for granted
take the heat
take the plunge
take what someone says with a pinch of salt
talk shop
a tall tale
tar someone with the same brush
the ball is in your court
the be all and end all
the bottom line
the fine print
the icing on the cake
know the ins and outs
the last straw
the pits
the tip of the iceberg
the whole shebang
the word spread
there's nothing to it
think twice
through the roof
throw a fit
tie the knot
time flies
to each his own
hold out an olive branch
keep something at bay
tongue-tied
twist somebody's arm
under your breath
under the gun
under the sun
under the weather
until you are blue in the face
up for grabs
up in the air
up to something
up to speed
up-and-coming
ups and downs
wake up and smell the coffee
walking on air
watch like a hawk
water down
weather a storm
well off
wet behind the ears
when all is said and done
when it rains, it pours
when pigs fly
when push comes to shove
whet your appetite
with flying colors
wolf in sheep's clothing
work your butt off
you would not be caught dead
you can say that again!
you name it
you rock
you sold me (on something)
